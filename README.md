#Module 3 - JavaScript API Consumption

###Sanitago's course
I attended Santiago's class every day. It was extremely insightful and thourough on the in-and-outs of API's in general. It gave me a deeper understanding on the fundamentals of working with API's, the methods used, CRUD, and how to use Postman for testing the API's.
<br/>
It was also very interesting seeing Santiago working on the API backend during the class, giving a bit more insight into the logic of the API backend. Also, I found it interesting to hear his take on the theoretical approach to building API's versus his 'real-life' methods of mainly using GET and POST in his projects for clients.
<br/>
I really enjoyed the class and teaching methods.
